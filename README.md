P2 Categories
=============

This is a Fork of Automattic's P2 Theme, with added support for posting into categories via a handy drop-down menu on the front page. 

This project has evolved from an article I've written which explained how to bring back posting into categories. The full process is explained here: http://wpguru.co.uk/2013/10/how-to-add-drop-down-categories-to-automattics-p2-theme/

What served as a working example is now a fully working theme which is compatible with Automattic's wonderful P2 (which is sadly no longer in development).

I have included several community suggested bug fixes and improvements that have not yet made it into P2 Core.


Installation
============

This entire project is a WordPress Theme. Download and install just like any other theme, either by uploading this repo as a ZIP, or by searching for "p2" under Appearance - Themes - Install.


How does P2 Categories work, and how do I use it?
=================================================

Simply write your post from the front page (as you do on P2), then select a category from the drop down menu and hit post. 

The menu only shows existing categories, even empty ones. You cannot create new categories from the front page though. To do so, please use the admin interface and head over to Posts - Categories, then add a new category.

Known Issues
============

The category drop-down menu no longer works in Safari 10 on a Mac. Still works fine in Firefox and Microsoft Edge, and Safari 9. Thanks, Apple!
