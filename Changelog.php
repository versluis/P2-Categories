/* P2 Categories - CHANGELOG

v1.6 - May 2018
* this version is a complete re-write
* rebuilt P2 Categories from my notes, based on P2 v1.5.8 (2016)
* fixed the category drop down menu
* fixed a bug that did not displayed the number of posts in more than one category 
* updated a call to a deprecated WordPress function wp_get_current_user()
* fixed several PHP 7 deprecation warnings
* updated class constructors to use __construct() methods
* hunted down undocumented features and documented them
* added this changelog file (yey!)

v1.5 - sometime in 2013
* unreleased beta version

v1.4 - October 2013
* removed category display from archive pages
* categories are not shown if posts are in "uncategorized"
* added post count to category meta display (just like P2 tags)
* turned project back into a full fork again, it's no longer a child theme (category posting didn't work as a child, hence the change back)
* can be used with other P2 child themes, such as P2 Responsive https://github.com/nmec/p2-responsive
